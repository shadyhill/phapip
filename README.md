# pHAPIp (happy)

Insipired by the work done on [Sandman][1] in Python, the aim of pHAPIp is to create an easy to use RESTful API controlled by a simple configuration file. Most of the work is done through inspection of the database to discover a model's fields and relations. The configuration file enables control over settings such as custom endpoints and required and excluded fields.
